**DATA VISUALIZATION**

 ****

Data visualization is a powerful tool for developing understanding and communication of complex data. It involves representing the data in graphs, charts, pictorial form which allows the user to see the trends, patterns, in a useful manner. It’s a very helpful process to gain insights from the data and make data driven decision making.

**TOOLS OF DATA VISUALIZATION**

Now data visualization is done with the help of software, broadly it can be classified into two categories: spreadsheet data visualization and programming libraries like R. Spreadsheets, such as Excel and Google Sheets, are one of the most familiar data visualization tools used in various areas. They give basic data visualization facilities, such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots.

Programming Libraries - such as Matplotlib, ggplot2, are a type of data visualization tool that can be used to create custom, and more advanced data visualizations. They provide a more valuable and customizable method for data visualization but require a higher level of technical expertise. You must be familiar with coding to use these kinds of libraries.

**TECHNIQUES IN DATA VISUALIZATION**

There are many techniques used in data visualization, some of them are.

Bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, heat maps, and network diagrams are all types of data visualizations that can represent different data types.

1\.       Bar charts are useful when comparing data across categories, the length of each bar showing the magnitude of data at a certain point of time.

2\.       A line graph is used to show the trends in the data over the period.

3\.       Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between two variables. A series of points represents a pair of values for two variables.

4\.       Heat maps are useful in visualizing the distribution of values in a matrix or table. The color of each cell in a colored grid represents the magnitude of a particular data point.

5\.       Network diagrams are useful in visualizing relationships between units, consisting of nodes representing units and edges representing relationships, where the size and color of nodes and edges can represent data attributes.

**BENEFITS OF DATA VISUALIZATION**

Data visualization makes complex data simple and insightful. It’s an essential tool for story telling with the data. By converting the data into visual narrative, it becomes easy to highlight the point of interest. Indeed, data visualization is a powerful tool that transforms raw data into valuable assets.
